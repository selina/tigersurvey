# TigerSurvey

a novel experience sampling/ecological momentary assessment tool for social science research! to use, 
1. create a new xcode project 
2. copy the files in this repo into the project
3. run 'pod install' to install the necessary libraries (if using your own backend, remove the lines for Firebase) 
4. change the questions in Data.swift to suit your research needs

you will probably also want to make significant edits to the language and interface to achieve your desired impression. 
an app that allows researchers to design and distribute surveys from within the app itself is upcoming--in the meantime, some familiarity with Swift is required :)
